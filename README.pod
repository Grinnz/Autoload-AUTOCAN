Autoload::FromCAN - Easily set up autoloading

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package My::Class;
  use Moo; # or object system of choice
  use Autoload::FromCAN;
  
  has count => (is => 'rw', default => 0);
  
  sub increment { $_[0]->count($_[0]->count + 1) }
  
  sub can {
    my ($self, $method) = @_;
    return sub { $_[0]->increment } if $method =~ m/inc/;
    return undef;
  }
  
  1;
  
  # elsewhere
  my $obj = My::Class->new;
  $obj->inc;
  say $obj->count; # 1
  $obj->increment; # existing method, not autoloaded
  say $obj->count; # 2
  $obj->do_increment;
  say $obj->count; # 3
  $obj->explode; # method not found error

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Autoloading|perlsub/"Autoloading"> is a very powerful mechanism for
dynamically handling function calls that are not defined. However, its
implementation is very complicated. For the simple case where you wish to
allow method calls to methods that don't yet exist, this module allows you to
define a C<can> method which will return either a code reference or C<undef>.
Autoloaded method calls will call C<can> and then run the returned method, or
throw the expected error if C<undef> is returned, so you can generate code or
delegate the method call as desired.

C<AUTOLOAD> affects standard function calls in addition to method calls. By
default, the C<AUTOLOAD> provided by this module will die (as Perl normally
does without a defined C<AUTOLOAD>) if a nonexistent function is called without
a class or object invocant. If you wish to autoload functions instead of
methods, you can pass C<functions> as an import argument, and the installed
C<AUTOLOAD> will attempt to autoload functions using C<can> from the current
package.

  package My::Functions;
  use Autoload::FromCAN 'functions';
  
  sub can {
    my ($package, $function) = @_;
    return sub { $_[0]x5 } if $function =~ m/dup/;
    return undef;
  }
  
  # elsewhere
  say My::Functions::duplicate('foo'); # foofoofoofoofoo
  say My::Functions::foo('bar'); # undefined subroutine error
